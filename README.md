# Social Media Intern
Your own personal tweet factory. Add articles and associated tweet copy to a google sheet, add a list of general hashtags to another. 
The bot chooses an article and related text to tweet, and selects three random hashtags to include so as to always generate a unique tweet. 

Born from a conversation with a housemate about SEO optimisation and the importance of generating mountains of backlinks. Also from a desire to learn C# and have fun with APIs. 
The bot is designed to run on a raspi, running windows 10 IOT.
